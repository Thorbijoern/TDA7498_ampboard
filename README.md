# TDA7498_ampboard
 unfinshed KiCAD design of an audio amplifier board with TDA7498


information about the amp can be found here: https://www.st.com/en/audio-ics/tda7498.html

I did not finish the schematic and there is no board layout.
Missing are mainly the 3.3V supply and the frequency shift circuit.
I stopped working on it and changed to using another chip for my usecase due to lacking documentation from ST micro.
